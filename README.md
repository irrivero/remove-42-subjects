# remove-42-subjects
A simple shell script to remove all instances of en.subject.pdf files (and variants like en.subject (1).pdf) from a 42 school's Git repository history using git filter-repo. This tool helps you clean up sensitive or copyrighted materials from your projects â€” even when the files are buried in subdirectories or have special characters in their names.
